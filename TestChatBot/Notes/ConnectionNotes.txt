CONNECTING TO A CHANNEL
	var connector = new ConnectorClient(new Uri(activity.ServiceUrl)) => creates a connector specifically for the requested URI via channel
		- the reference is to make sure the reply from bot goes back to the same URI that sent the request
		- channel end points may not be stable, so communications SHOULD BE directed to the endpoint that the connector references in the activity object
		- if needing to rely on cache for specifying different end points (ie: forwarding to different conversation IDs), need to refresh chache often
