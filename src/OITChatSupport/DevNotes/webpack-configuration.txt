1. polyfills scripts are moved from index.html to the webpack.config.js file and compiled/bundled with the TS files
2. move any external html templates/stylesheets (outside the main module/componet) inline
3. add reference to index.html for entry point bundle

Compile/bundle TS files
	- before we had to use ts cli to transpile the TS code to JS
	- move into webpack config file which comes with the ts-loader (awesome-typescript-loader) that auto handles it when running the webpack compilation

Adding a reference to the index.html for the new bundled resource
	- the output destination of the bundled resource must be referenced in the index.html file (ex: <app></app>)
	- can use html-webpack-plugin to handle this as well


Additional configurations
	- Ahead of time compilation: https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler
	- using the wwwroot folder in asp.net core
	- tree shaking 
	- running tests via webpack
	- using webpack dev server with HMR
